## Key Architectural Patterns Identified

### 1. Configuration Approaches
- **Environment-first**: Most successful implementations use extensive environment variables
- **Modular configuration**: Separate config files for different concerns (conf.d pattern)
- **Template interpolation**: Dynamic configuration generation from environment variables

### 2. Module Management
- **Community integration**: Automatic cloning of prosody-modules repository
- **Selective enabling**: Environment variables to choose specific modules
- **Symlink systems**: Clean module enabling/disabling mechanisms

### 3. Security Patterns
- **Encryption by default**: Require TLS/SSL for all connections
- **Certificate automation**: Automatic certificate discovery and management
- **Non-root execution**: Run as dedicated prosody user
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in connection rate limiting
- **Anti-spam systems**: DNS blocklist integration and user quarantine

### 4. Database Integration
- **Multi-database support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3
- **Automatic detection**: Detect when SQL storage is needed
- **Environment configuration**: Database settings via environment variables

### 5. Deployment Patterns
- **Docker Compose ready**: Comprehensive compose examples
- **Volume separation**: Separate volumes for config, data, certificates
- **Multi-architecture**: ARM support for IoT/embedded deployments
- **Multi-stage builds**: Optimize image size and security

### 6. Enterprise Features
- **REST APIs**: Administrative interfaces for programmatic management
- **Web interfaces**: User registration and administration
- **Monitoring**: Statistics and health checking
- **Professional support**: Commercial backing and maintenance

## Best Practices Synthesis
