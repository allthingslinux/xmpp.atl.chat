- **Multi-Domain Support**: Handles main domain and subdomains

## Technical Implementation

### Dockerfile Analysis
```dockerfile
FROM debian:bullseye
# Uses official Prosody trunk version
# Includes comprehensive module installation
# Proper security with setcap for port binding
```

### Configuration Highlights
- **359 lines** of comprehensive Prosody configuration
- **Extensive module list**: 25+ modules enabled by default
- **Security-first**: All encryption and authentication enforced
- **Production-ready**: Contact info, limits, and monitoring configured

### Entrypoint Script
- **123 lines** of sophisticated initialization
- **Environment validation**: Ensures all required variables are set
- **Database setup**: Proper ownership and permissions
- **Certificate management**: Automatic certificate import and renewal
- **Anti-spam setup**: Dynamic firewall rule generation

## Strengths
1. **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive feature set for real-world deployment
2. **Security Focus**: Advanced anti-spam and security features
3. **Web Integration**: Complete web-based management and registration
4. **Certificate Automation**: Fully automated certificate management
5. **Documentation**: Excellent README with clear setup instructions
6. **Active Maintenance**: Recent commits and updates
7. **Anti-Spam Innovation**: Sophisticated spam prevention system

## Weaknesses
1. **Complexity**: High complexity may be overwhelming for simple deployments
2. **Dependencies**: Requires external services (hCaptcha, DNS configuration)
3. **Size**: Larger image due to comprehensive feature set
4. **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of anti-spam system
5. **Limited Environment Variables**: Only 4 core environment variables vs 50+ in official

## Use Cases
- **Production XMPP Servers**: Ideal for public-facing XMPP servers
- **Anti-Spam Requirements**: Perfect for servers needing spam protection
- **Web Registration**: Servers requiring user-friendly registration
- **Certificate Automation**: Deployments needing automatic certificate management

## Comparison with Other Implementations
- **More Feature-Rich**: Than basic implementations like djmaze/docker-prosody
- **Production-Focused**: Compared to development-oriented containers
- **Security-Enhanced**: Advanced security features beyond standard implementations
- **Web-Integrated**: More web features than typical Docker implementations

## Recommendation
**Highly Recommended** for production deployments requiring advanced features, anti-spam protection, and web integration. This implementation represents a sophisticated, real-world solution that goes beyond basic Prosody containerization.

## Key Takeaways for Implementation
1. **Anti-spam systems** are crucial for public XMPP servers
2. **Web registration** improves user experience significantly
3. **Certificate automation** is essential for production deployments
4. **Comprehensive module integration** provides full XMPP feature set
5. **Security-first approach** should be default for production systems

## Implementation Priority
